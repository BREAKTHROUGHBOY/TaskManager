# 🧠 Task Manager CLI – Personal Life Operating System [Module 01]

> ⚙️ A clean, modular, terminal-based task tracker designed to help you organize your mission-critical life tasks — built using core Python OOP and JSON for persistence.  
> 🧱 Part of the **Personal Life Operating System (PLOS)** Project by [King Trillionare](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME).

## 🚀 Project Vision

This is the first modular component of my larger mission: to build a **Personal Life Operating System (PLOS)** that centralizes your habits, goals, learning, journals, and systems — all powered by intelligent automation and full-stack extensibility.

The `Task Manager CLI` lets you:
- Add, update, view, delete personal tasks
- Track task status (pending, completed, etc.)
- Auto-save to local JSON file
- Load data automatically on restart

---

## 📦 Features

- ✅ OOP-based `Task` and `TaskManager` classes
- ✅ Clean CLI interface for real-world use
- ✅ Auto-generated unique task IDs
- ✅ Optional fields: due dates, statuses, tags
- ✅ JSON-based data persistence
- ✅ `update_task` system to modify name or status
- ✅ Modular, extensible design

---

## 🧠 How It Works

```

main.py
├── TaskManager class
├── Task class
├── CLI input loop (add/update/delete/view/save)
├── JSON file storage

````

Data is stored in `data_saver.json` in dictionary format. On start, tasks are auto-loaded and displayed.

## 💻 Tech Stack

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Python 3.x` | Core logic |
| `OOP` | Modular, scalable design |
| `uuid`, `datetime` | Unique IDs, timestamps |
| `json` | Data storage |
| `CLI` | User interaction |

---

## 🧪 Sample Run (Terminal Output)

```bash
> python main.py

========= TASK MANAGER =========

[1] Add Task | [2] Remove Task | [3] Update Task
[4] View Tasks | [5] Save Tasks | [6] Exit

Enter your choice: 1
> Task name: Learn FastAPI
> Status: pending
> Task 'Learn FastAPI' added successfully!
